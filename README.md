Hi, I'm Decy. I am passionate about programming, science, history, and economics. Currently, I am a student at JCTC and will soon be transferring to WKU. I love studying and learning new things, and I am very open-minded. I work hard because I am determined to achieve my goals.

I also enjoy working out, smelling good, dressing well, and helping people. I aspire to dedicate my life to a purposeful existence, aiming to bring positive changes to society.
